## Creating QR codes with R

There is a package called `qrcode` which generates nice little codes which are persistent and free. After installing the package, use the following code, where destination is the URL you wish the code to direct to.

````
library(qrcode)

destination <- "https://jjcurtin.quarto.pub/precision-mental-health-for-substance-use-disorders-7561"


qr <- qr_code(destination, ecl = c("L", "M", "Q", "H"))

plot(qr)
````

Then save the plot as an image file.
