# Virtual Machines

## CCI Admin Console

The VMs are administered through the [CCI Cloud Console](https://cci-one-vra-01.cci.wisc.edu/csp/gateway/portal/#/consumer). 

Authenticate with your NetID followed by @ad.wisc.edu, then hit Service Broker. In the left sidebar is a Deployments item; expand that and click Virtual Machines.
