# Current and Planned Stuides

We list potential study ideas below, organized by project/data set.  When projects have been tentatively claimed, that is indicated as well

## RISK
- Compare insight only to full EMA for lapse risk prediction [Gaylen (lead), Kendra, Ariela, Sarah]
- GPS features solo for lapse risk prediction [Claire FYP (lead)]
- Less burdensome EMA for lapse risk prediction. Maybe only morning.  Maybe only some items.  Maybe only some items depending on responses to other items [Coco?]
- Use text message content & meta data for lapse prediction [Coco?]
- Replicate stressor use with RISK data.  MLM analyses [unassigned]
- Full model using GPS, EMA, communications for lapse risk prediction [unassigned]
- Lagged week level models for  lapse risk prediction.   Maybe 3 days, 1 week, two weeks lag [unassigned]
- Model duration of lapse rather than binary outcome to allow move toward harm reduction approaches
- Model lapses that are labeled (or quantified) on severity based on chaining, or perhaps the respone to them (what the say about future ab goal, EMA affect after, etc)
- Establish individual lapse as a clinically meaningful event - use lapse/no lapse as feature to predict variety of negative outcomes from (next? subsequent period?) EMAs, e.g., craving, risky situations, stressful events, negative affect, self-efficacy/change of abstinence goal (abstinence violation effect). Account for previous negative outcome level (either include as covariate [feature]? or make outcome a change score) [unassigned]

## RISK2


## NRT1
- Build machine learning model for smoking lapse risk prediction (e.g., replicate RISK ema paper) [unassigned]
