# Global Protect and Mapping the Network Server

## Global Protect

After you install GlobalProtect vis [these instructions](https://kb.wisc.edu/helpdesk/page.php?id=90370), connecting is nearly identical on Mac or Windows PC:

1.	Open the GlobalProtect client by selecting the icon at the top of your screen (Mac) or in the system tray (PC). (If it does not automatically appear in this place, access the client through your Finder's Applications folder (Mac) or Start Menu (PC).) 

    a. If it is your first time connecting, you will be prompted to enter a portal address. The default portal is **uwmadison.vpn.wisc.edu**.
    b. If you have used GlobalProtect before, you will be connected to the portal you last used. This can be changed by opening the settings menu on the top right of the client login screen.

2.	Enter your netid followed by _1 (to use your Static IP) and password (regular NetID password) and click Sign In. If you are prompted to use Duo MFA, enter the passcode from your fob/Duo Mobile app or enter "1" to receive a push on your mobile device.

### Troubleshooting Global Protect on Mac OSX
If the client never connects and just "spins", this issue could be related to a security setting for the Mac Keychain. Properly restart the computer by clicking restart, and making sure the "Reopen windows when logging back in" is unchecked as shown here:

Once the computer restarts and GlobalProtect restarts upon booting back up, there will eventually be a prompt that pops up. It may ask for permission for GlobalProtect to use confidential information from the Keychain. The password should be the computer's Admin password, or their Apple ID password. Once the password has been entered, click "Always allow". Afterward, GlobalProtect should be able to move past the "Connecting" phase and will prompt for username and password as usual.
