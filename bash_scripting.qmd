# Bash Scripting

## Getting Started

- start scripts with shebang (#!/bin/bash)
- use comments (#)
- make executable fie everyone (chmod 755 foo.sh) or just you (chmod 700 foo.sh)
- execute in subshell using ./foo.sh (if in current directory)
- source in current shell using source foo.sh or . foo.sh (again if in current directory)
- Consider where to save
  - can be run from anywhere if saved in PATH (~/bin for you or /usr/local/bin for everyone)
  - need to type full filename and path to run if not in path
  
  
## General
  
assignment to variable in subprocess
- x=1
